## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding the basics of quantum mechanics while using GitHub
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m intersting learning how to improve my coding skills but mostly understanding the Schrodinger equation. I enjoy learning about inorganic chemistry, how the catalyst works and what reaction they do. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: One of my main Hobbies is embroidment, I love creating small or big pieces to ornate my lab coat or other pieces of fabric.
